First, we would like to run a linear regression to find the best predictor of the age of abalone shell.

```{r,results='markup'}
lm1 <- lm(Rings~Length+Diameter+Height+WholeWeight+ShuckedWeight+VisceraWeight+ShellWeight, data = abalone)
summary(lm1)
```

According to the result of the regression, we can get that the equation is as following:
`Rings` = 2.985-1.572`Length`+13.361`Diameter`+11.826`Height`+9.247`WholeWeight`-20.214`ShuckedWeight`-9.830`VisceraWeight`+8.576`ShellWeight`
Because we get a very small P-value and the adjusted R-squared is 0.5268, we can say that this model is statistically significant.
Meanwhile, all of the variables except `Length` are statistically significant. 
We can make the conclusion that the best predictor in physical measurement is `ShuckedWeight`, which means the weight of meat.
